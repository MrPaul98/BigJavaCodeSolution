This is my solution based on exercises by Big Java 2nd Edition from Cay Horstmann. 

Some of the chapter in this repository may have a complete solution but some are still not complete yet. Yeah, I'm just lazy enough not to find the solution since I had my hand full for the other boring things in my life.

Since I gave this solution code for free. I do not intend to to list down all the details of the solution in each of folder. Please lurk around my folder for each exercises you interested to get an answer and try it yourself.

Anyway, feel free to update error known in my exercises code or if you want to upgrade my code as necessary, it's really my pleasure and your contribution is highly appreciated.

Have fun!
