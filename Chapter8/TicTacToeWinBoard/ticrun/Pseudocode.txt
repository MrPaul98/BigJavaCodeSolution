Disclaimer 

There are many ways to solve a problem.
I do not post codes before the due date, since that does not help you.
Codes may be incorrect because I am also a learner like you. Use it at your discretion.
 Guidelines 
1. Your method should perform 4 checks
Check each row.
Check each column.
Check top-left to bottom-right diagonal.
Check top-right to bottom-left diagonal. 
2. In the game runner
Check for occupied space, if a space on the board is occupied, player should be prompted to select new row and column.
Check total moves to print a draw result

Pseudocode 

//// playerWon method
INITIALIZE playerWon to false
INITIALIZE count to zero 
// Check for the same player on the same row
FOR each row on the board
 FOR each column on the board
  IF player EQUALS board element(row,column) THEN
   INCREMENT count
  END IF
 END FOR
 // Check if player wins
 IF count EQUALS 3 THEN
  SET playerWon to true
  stop checking for next case
 END IF
 SET count to zero
END FOR 
// Check for the same player on the same column
IF NOT playerWon
 FOR each column on the board
  FOR each row on the board
   IF player EQUALS board element(column,row) THEN
    INCREMENT count
   END IF
  END FOR
  // Check if player wins
